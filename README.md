# Bellabeat Data Analysis Project
## Methods Used
* SQL
* Tableau

## Business Task
Analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights discovered will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### Clear Statement of Business Task
Determine how non-Bellabeat users utilize their smart-devices to determine what trends can be applied to Bellabeat customers and increase usage and customer base?

## Datasource
The data used in this project was made available through [Mobius]<https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic> and utilized public [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data]<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit> under a *CC0: Public Domain* license.

## Data limitations
I would like to further evaluate weight trends both through sleep, calories burned, and activity minutes, however, the dataset provided does not provide an adequate amount of weight data to provide an accurate analysis. After viewing the weight_log dataset, there was no enough unique users who tracked their weight in the timeframe of the dataset which spanned one month. If there is a desire to understand how users utilize fitness trackers for weight management, more data would be needed both in the timespan of the data in addition to more users participating in providing weight data consistently throughout the study.

The sleep data may only provide part of the story relating to total calories burned and does not communicate any other effects that sleep difference may have had on users such as energy levels throughout the day, alertness, or other benefits of sleep.

Lastly, there are only 33 participants who tracked information over the course of one month. Both factors provide extreme limitations in determining trends in each area of usage that is tracked. In addition to needing a larger dataset, it would be beneficial to have some other information, such as sex, health/fitness goals, and height. Knowing the sex of the participants would allow me to filter the dataset to align with Bellabeat's target demographic. Knowing the participant's health and fitness goals will allow me to explore if the goals are being met or worked toward. Knowing height will allow for a deeper understanding when exploring steps and distance totals, as individuals of different heights will have varying stride lengths and can cause a skew in the data if there is a skew in height of the participants.

## Tableau Dashboard/Visualization
The dashboard designed for this project was laid out in a way that emulates Bellabeat's design language found on their **[website]<https://www.bellabeat.com/>** at the time of design. This is to provide cohesiveness for the organization's visualization and meet their standard for quality. This dashboard's purpose is to make it easy to understand how participants in the dataset used their Fitbit devices and will also provide the elements for the presentation that will be used with the executive team.
